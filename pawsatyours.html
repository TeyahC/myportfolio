      <h2>Project Walkthrough</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Paws at Yours</strong> is a fully responsive and visually engaging cat sitting website. It's designed to feel welcoming and friendly while making it easy for potential clients to learn about the service and get in touch.
      </p>

      <h3>Homepage</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage features a warm collage of my own cats, creating an immediate connection with visitors. Beneath the collage is a <strong>slideshow gallery</strong> that automatically scrolls through photos. Users can also navigate manually, and doing so <strong>resets the slideshow timer</strong>‚Äîallowing time to focus on a particular image.
      </p>
      <p>
        A clear <strong>‚ÄúBook Now‚Äù</strong> button links straight to the contact page, making booking quick and accessible. There's also a direct link to the <strong>price list</strong>‚Äîperfect for visitors who are only looking for pricing information.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the top of the page is a <strong>menu button</strong> that triggers a full-screen overlay menu with five key navigation options.
      </p>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Selecting <strong>‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù</strong> in the menu opens a page with a short biography about me, explaining my background and passion for cat care. As you scroll down, you‚Äôll see <strong>photos and descriptions</strong> of my own cats, giving potential clients insight into the love and attention I give my pets.

      <h3>Cat-alogue</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>Cat-alogue</strong> page showcases a gallery of cats I‚Äôve looked after over the years. It gives credibility and shows experience, helping build trust with new clients.

      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>Contact Us</strong> page offers three ways to get in touch: via <strong>WhatsApp, Facebook</strong>, or a <strong>direct email form</strong>. The form is designed to be quick and easy to use, sending inquiries straight to my inbox.
