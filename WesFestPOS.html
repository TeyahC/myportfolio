            WesFest POS is a progressive web application (PWA) I built to handle
            snack sales at festivals. The system was designed with both staff
            and administrators in mind, making it easy to manage items, track
            orders, and process payments quickly in a busy festival environment.
            By integrating Square’s POS API, the app supported secure card
            payments while remaining lightweight, mobile-friendly, and
            easy-to-use on the night of the event.

          <h2>Project Functionality</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left">
            My partner’s parents were hosting a festival at their house and
            wanted a fun “honesty snack station.” Guests could grab snacks
            freely but also had the option to pay by card. After some research,
            I decided to build a custom POS system tailored for the event.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left">
            The system included an <strong>Admin Page</strong> for quickly
            adding or removing products, and a <strong>Main POS Page</strong>
            where guests could browse items, add them to their cart, and check
            out using Square’s secure payment process. After checkout, the app
            redirected back to the main page with an empty cart, ready for the
            next order.
          </p>

          <div class="screenshot-block">
            <h3>Admin Features</h3>
            <p>
              The admin dashboard allowed products to be added or removed
              quickly to keep the snack station up to date throughout the
              festival.

              Guests could browse snacks, add them to the cart, and pay securely
              via Square. After checkout, the cart cleared automatically for the
              next person.
